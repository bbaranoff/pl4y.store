   **Radio-Frequencies Protocols :**
   ---------------------------------

   A protocol is for computing (quoted from Oxford langage):
   "A set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices."
   <https://www.oed.com/>.

   The goal like it is said is to make travel information from A->B, and (maybe) then B->A etcaetera. This information has a weight and it has to move so : energy is spent, at least F(A->B).
   Another goals came obviously from the first depending on the case of use : spending the less energy possible, have the maximum range, transmit the most data possible, have the best yield, and be the most secure possible (I mean by that, that it can't be understood by a machine or an human on an undesired endpoint in a reasonable time at least at the time of conception and from the projected advances in technology), there are also another important points the latency, and the errors between the message sent and received.

**Example of SFR:**
-----------------------

**Article 1**

– The French Radiotelephone Company ("Société  Française de Radiotéléphonie") is authorized to use, in the
900 and 1800 MHz bands, the frequencies allocated to it in Article 2 of this decision to establish and operate a radio network open to the public in metropolitan France. For this, it complies with the provisions of the specifications located in appendix 2 of this decision.

**Article 2**

– The GSM channels allocated to the French Radiotelephone Company are, in accordance with the definitions in appendix 1:


* 
  in the 900 MHz band, throughout mainland France: channels 75 to 124;

* 
  in the 900 MHz band, only in very dense areas: channels 63 to 74;

* 
  in the 1800 MHz band, throughout mainland France: channels 512 to 525
  and 647 to 751

For others Operator (GSM)
